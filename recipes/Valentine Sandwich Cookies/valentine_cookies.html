    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon almond extract (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cream butter and confectioners' sugar together in a large bowl. Beat in egg, vanilla, and almond extract.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, baking soda, and cream of tartar together in a medium bowl. Add to butter mixture; beat until dough is just combined. Divide dough into thirds and shape each portion into a ball.</li>
        <li>Place one portion of dough on a lightly floured surface and roll out to 1/4-inch thickness. For each sandwich cookie, cut out two 3-inch hearts; cut out the center of one of the hearts with a 1 1/2-inch cutter. Place cutout pieces 1 to 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 7 to 8 minutes. Cool completely on wire racks.</li>
        <li>Frost each solid 3-inch cookie with <a href="../Pink Valentine Frosting/pv_frosting.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Pink Valentine Frosting</a> and top with an open-centered cookie to form a sandwich. Frost the remaining small hearts and serve as separate cookies.</li>
